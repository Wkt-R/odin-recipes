# odin-recipes
That's the first project on my journey with Odin. 
It's going to be a simple HTML and CSS project.
I don't think any of it may be challenging for me now that I know a fair bit of programming already, but I don't mind refreshing basic stuff either and want to prepare myself for Ruby and Rails projects as best as this course offers.
